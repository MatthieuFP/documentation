# oscar-tools

`oscar-tools` is a toolkit that was created along with [OSCAR-2201](versions/oscar-2201.md) to make operations on the corpus easy and fast.

At its core, `oscar-tools` provides a set of operations targeted at a **given OSCAR version**. As such, you shoudn't expect to have all operations available on all OSCAR versions. For example, at the time of writing, `deduplicate` is not available for OSCAR 22.01-like corpora. 

The CLI of `oscar-tools` is still a bit messy and can be confusing, because we are actively working on it and on implementing essential features.
